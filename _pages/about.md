# Bio

My name is Ge Chunjiang. I am currently a fourth year PhD student in Tsinghua University. I have 3 first author papers and have received more than 200 citations now. With the help of foundation models, the potential of artificial intelligence has barely been tapped. I am dedicated to using AI for the benefit of human society. My current interest is working towards enabling machine learning models to understand the open world, interact with the open world using tools, and most importantly change of the world. Achieving this goal requires integrating technologies across large language models, AI agents, multimodal and embodied intelligence.

我是葛春江，目前是清华大学四年级的博士生。在大模型的帮助下，人工智能的潜力还远远没有被发掘，我致力于用人工智能来造福人类社会。当前的我当前的兴趣是致力于使机器学习模型可以理解开放世界，并通过利用工具和开放世界交互，并改变世界的状态。实现这个目标需要将大语言模型，AI Agent，多模态和具身智能多个领域的技术融合。

I am now a Ph.d student of Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Gao huang](http://www.gaohuang.net/). Before coming to Department of Automation, I received B.S. in Department of Physics, Tsinghua University.

我目前就读于清华大学自动化系。我的导师是黄高教授。在来到自动化系之前，我在清华大学物理系获得了学士学位。

Innovative work today often requires teamwork. If you are also very interested in my current research direction and have some technical background, I warmly welcome collaborating with me. If you are at Tsinghua University, it will be even more convenient for us to communicate. I will do my best as a team leader to utilize cutting-edge research findings and technical solutions to make contributions to the development of AI across scientific problems, open source projects, and different domains.

现在的创新性的工作往往需要一个团队来完成，如果你对我当前的研究方向也十分感兴趣并拥有一定的技术基础，非常欢迎和我合作，如果你在清华，我们交流会更加方便。我会尽我所能做好一个团队的leader，利用最前沿的科研成果和技术方案在科学问题、开源项目不同领域为人工智能的发展做出贡献。
